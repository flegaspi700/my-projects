Practicing with Sub-Queries
Step 1
Click on Navigation menu > BigQuery.

Step 2
Click DONE.

Step 3
Write the below query in the query EDITOR.

Step 4
Using the provided query WITH clause below, write a SELECT statement that follows which calculates the avg_income (revenue - expenses) and sort the results by avg_income highest to lowest.

Also include year_filed and the other metrics from the WITH clause in your result.

#standardSQL
WITH summary AS (
# count of filings, revenue, expenses since 2013
SELECT
  CONCAT("20",_TABLE_SUFFIX) AS year_filed,
  COUNT(ein) AS nonprofit_count,
  AVG(totrevenue) AS avg_revenue,
  AVG(totfuncexpns) AS avg_expenses
FROM `bigquery-public-data.irs_990.irs_990_20*`
WHERE _TABLE_SUFFIX >= '13'
GROUP BY year_filed
ORDER BY year_filed DESC
)

# write your code here
Step 5
Compare your result against the solution below:

#standardSQL
WITH summary AS (
# count of filings, revenue, expenses since 2013
SELECT
  CONCAT("20",_TABLE_SUFFIX) AS year_filed,
  COUNT(ein) AS nonprofit_count,
  AVG(totrevenue) AS avg_revenue,
  AVG(totfuncexpns) AS avg_expenses
FROM `bigquery-public-data.irs_990.irs_990_20*`
WHERE _TABLE_SUFFIX >= '13'
GROUP BY year_filed
ORDER BY year_filed DESC
)

SELECT
  year_filed,
  nonprofit_count,
  avg_revenue,
  avg_expenses,
  avg_revenue - avg_expenses AS avg_income
FROM summary
ORDER BY avg_income DESC
Step 6
Click RUN.

Step 7

Which Year had the highest `avg_income`? What was it?

2015 with 541,214.61

2013 with 332,923.28

2011 with 293,219.11
