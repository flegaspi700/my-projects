#Python Data Structures
#Python has a number of built-in data structures that you can use to store collections of data.

#Linked Lists
#Linked lists are a data structure that store a sequence of data elements, 
#   each of which is connected to the next element in the sequence.
#Linked lists are a good choice for storing sequences of data elements that are not too long.

#example
#Create a linked list
#Create a class Node:
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.next = None
